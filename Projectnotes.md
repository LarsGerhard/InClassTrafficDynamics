# Traffic Model In Class Written Work
Q1/2: See Trafficmodel.py

Q3: Increasing a increases the acceleration of the car at the beginning and results
in the car stopping sooner, since it hits its ideal velocity more quickly. Increasing
b results in a sharper stop at the end, meaning that the car maintains its ideal
velocity for longer

Q4: It cuts off the model much earlier if it's close, meaning that the car can't 
accelerate to top speed. Far away the behaviour approaches that of no barrier, minus
the end points
